# ZendCon Apigility Workshop

This repository contains the slides for the ZendCon 2015 Apigility tutorial.
They're written using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), and
can be served as a vanilla HTML-based application.

## Running the presentation

To run the presentation with speaker notes, you need a local web server. For
this, use `npm` and `grunt`:

```bash
$ npm install
$ grunt serve
```

At that point, the slides will be available at http://localhost:8000
